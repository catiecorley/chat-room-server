Creative portion: Users can permanently block other users so that the blocked user cannot join the same chat room as them. Once blocked, the only way to communicate with each other is in the general room 'Open to all.' Users can block others even if they did not create the public/private chatroom. 
There is also a filterning system on the chats sent. There is a list of banned words and they will be censored if a user tries to send one of them.
